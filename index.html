            <div class="left-col1">
                <p id="p">Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows a team of detectives headed by the serious and intellectual Captain Raymond Holt. The detectives include Jake Peralta, an investigator with a high rate of solved cases despite his relaxed and often childish attitude, who eventually falls for his nerdy, by-the-book, but skilled partner, Amy Santiago. Jake's best friend, the timid and loyal Charles Boyle, is often partnered with the intense and aggressive Rosa Diaz. The two older detectives, Michael Hitchcock and Norm Scully, often seem incompetent and lazy, but were once legendary detectives. The detectives report to Sergeant, later Lieutenant, Terry Jeffords, a gentle giant and devoted family man. For the first five seasons and the initial episodes of the sixth, the precinct also includes sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti, who dislikes her job, plans her life around social media, and focuses on dancing as a life goal.
